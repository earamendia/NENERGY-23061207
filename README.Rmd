## Statement of need

Extended World Energy Balance (EWEB) data from the
[International Energy Agency (IEA)](http://www.iea.org) (IEA) 
are indispensable for societal energy analysis and
societal exergy analysis (SEA).



## History

The functions in this package were used in 
[Heun et al. [-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

Permission to distribute IEA extended energy balance data
for two years and two countries was obtained 
by Matthew Kuperus Heun from Nick Johnstone of the IEA
during a phone call at 11 AM on Mon, 3 June 2019.
